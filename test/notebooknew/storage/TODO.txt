# TODO
# - Rename "payload" to "attachment"
# More tests:
# - Typed attributes: dict, list/tuple, basestring, bool, int/long, float, None, Data, datetime.datetime, [other]
# FS specific tests:
# - Invalid path characters in node ids (?*/\)
# - Invalid path characters in payload names (?*/\)
# - XML containing a node id that does not correspond to the directory name: def test_fs_node_xml(self):
# - Verify that the written XML is what I expect it to be
# - Clean up unreferenced payload files
# - Use directory names based on the node's title, if present
# - Use the XML to verify whether a payload exists, not the file system
# - Tamper detection
